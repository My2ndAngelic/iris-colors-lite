.SH NAME
iris-colors-lite \- set color temperature of display according to time of day
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iris-colors-lite
\fI[\-l LAT:LON | \-l PROVIDER:OPTIONS] [\-t DAY:NIGHT] \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Iris-colors-lite
adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your
surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less or reduce the risk for
delayed sleep phase syndrome if you are working in front of the screen
at night.

The color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A
different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During
twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly
adapt over a period of about an hour. At night the color temperature
should be set to match the lamps in your room. This is typically a low
temperature at around 3000K\-4000K (default is 3500K). During the day,
the color temperature should match the light from outside, typically
around 5500K\-6500K (default is 5500K). The light has a higher
temperature on an overcast day.

.PP
The neutral temperature is 6500K. Using this value will not
change the color temperature of the display. Setting the
color temperature to a value higher than this results in
more blue light, and setting a lower value will result in
more red light.

Default temperature values:
.IP
Daytime: 5500K, night: 3500K
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
A configuration file with the name `iris-colors-lite.conf' can optionally be
placed in `~/.config/'. The file has standard INI format. General
program options are placed under the `iris-colors-lite' header, while options
for location providers and adjustment methods are placed under a
header with the name of that provider or method. General options are:
.TP
\fBtemp\-day\fR = integer
Daytime temperature
.TP
\fBtemp\-night\fR = integer
Night temperature
.TP
\fBtransition\fR = 0 or 1
Disable or enable transitions
.TP
\fBbrightness\-day\fR = 0.1\-1.0
Screen brightness at daytime
.TP
\fBbrightness\-night\fR = 0.1\-1.0
Screen brightness at night
.TP
\fBelevation-high\fR = decimal
The solar elevation for the transition to daytime
.TP
\fBelevation-low\fR = decimal
The solar elevation for the transition to night
.TP
\fBgamma\fR = R:G:B
Gamma adjustment to apply (day and night)
.TP
\fBgamma-day\fR = R:G:B
Gamma adjustment to apply at daytime
.TP
\fBgamma-night\fR = R:G:B
Gamma adjustment to apply at night
.TP
\fBadjustment\-method\fR = name
Select adjustment method. Options for the adjustment method can be
given under the configuration file heading of the same name.
.TP
\fBlocation\-provider\fR = name
Select location provider. Options for the location provider can be
given under the configuration file heading of the same name.
.PP
Options for location providers and adjustment methods can be found in
the help output of the providers and methods.
.SH EXAMPLE
Example for Sofia, Bulgaria:
.IP
\fB$\fR iris-colors-lite \-l 42.6:23.3 \-t 5700:3600 \-g 0.8 \-m randr \-v
.PP
An example configuration file with the same effect as the above
command line:
.IP
.nf
[\fBiris-colors-lite\fR]
temp\-day=5700
temp\-night=3600
gamma=0.8
adjustment\-method=randr
location\-provider=manual

[\fBmanual\fR]
lat=55.7
lon=12.6

.SH HOOKS
Executables (e.g. scripts) placed in folder `~/.config/iris-colors-lite/hooks'
will be run when a certain event happens. The first parameter to the
script indicates the event and further parameters may indicate
more details about the event. The event `period-changed' is indicated
when the period changes (`night', `daytime', `transition'). The second
parameter is the old period and the third is the new period. The event
is also signaled when iris-colors-lite starts up with the old period set to
`none'. Any dotfiles in the folder are skipped.

A simple script to handle these events can be written like this:
.IP
.nf
#!/bin/sh
case \fB$1\fR in
    \fBperiod-changed\fR)
        exec notify-send "iris-colors-lite" "Period changed to \fB$3\fR"

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
Iris-colors-lite won't affect the color of your cursor when your graphics driver
is configured to use hardware cursors. Some graphics drivers have an
option to disable hardware cursors in xorg.conf.
